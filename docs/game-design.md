# Game Design Overview

The project is a market simulation game with risk-based mechanics.

## Core Principles
- Risk vs reward
- Time-based opportunities
- Limited availability events
- Progression through consistency, not grinding

## Market Simulation
Prices change dynamically based on internal rules.
The system avoids predictable or linear behavior.

## Special Events
Limited-time events introduce:
- higher risk
- temporary advantages
- alternative progression paths

These mechanics are carefully balanced to avoid exploitation.
