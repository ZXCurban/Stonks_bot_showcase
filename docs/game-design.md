# Game Design Overview

The project is a market simulation game built around controlled risk-based mechanics.

## Core Principles
- Risk vs reward
- Time-based opportunities
- Limited availability events
- Progression through consistency rather than repetitive grinding

## Market Simulation
Asset prices change dynamically based on internal rules and scheduled updates.
The system intentionally avoids predictable or linear behavior to reduce
exploitable strategies and static optimization.

Market behavior is designed to reward long-term decision-making
rather than short-term pattern recognition.

## Special Events
Limited-time events introduce:
- increased risk exposure
- temporary mechanical advantages
- alternative progression paths

These events are isolated, time-bound, and enforced via system-level constraints
to prevent exploitation or permanent imbalance.
